2023 – what a rollercoaster of a year! It's like riding a bike through a storm; tough going, but oh, the stories you'll have to tell. Let's dive into this whirlwind of a year, shall we?

The year kicked off with a bang and not the good kind. I found myself in a tussle with the Lagos state government, all thanks to a video I made. Talk about being in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons! I learned a hard lesson: sometimes, silence is golden. I honestly blame myself because if I had kept quiet, I would have not even been noticed. 

I'm glad it's all over now.

Despite the rocky start, I didn't let it dampen my spirits. I applied for the UK Global Talent visa, and guess what? I got it!

Family-wise, I renovated my parents' house and achieved a financial goal that left me speechless.

**"﻿the kind money wey i touch this year dey baffle me"**, I said this earlier in the year when I looked at some of the invoices I sent out to clients. 

Career-wise, 2023 was a game of snakes and ladders. I got laid off in February, but in April I got a new job at a great company with great people!

Love and friendships? Couldn't be better. Celebrated two years with the love of my life – she's the melody to my life's song. And my friends? We're closer than ever, It's like finding your tribe and knowing you belong.

Looking forward to 2024, I want to move with audacity. This year taught me that the only thing holding me back is me. I want to level up in my career, spread happiness, and take care of my loved ones. I'm also planning to step back from social media and enjoy a quieter life. It's time to focus on the real, tangible world around me

2023, you've been a paradox, but as my Yoruba people say, "Kashamadupe"!\

Here's to a new year and new beginnings!
