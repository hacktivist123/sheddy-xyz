At the time of writing this, I haven’t found a topic for this article yet and I
don’t want to use the classic ‘My year in review’ so whenever you read this
article just know that I still don’t have a title and I have left it at what it
is.

2018 was awesome, I feel really emotional writing this article because I grew so
much mentally, physically[i’ve got a cool Beard :)], and also financially in
2018 compared to previous years.

My **TWENTY EIGHTEEN** really started for me in August because I was on my
School industrial training for 6months from the month of February until August.

I was serving in the IT Department of an Engineering Firm (GIL Automation), it
was really fun there because I met new people and made new friends. My boss at
the firm was a very down to earth and a nice man.

When I finished the Industrial training I had received offers and interview
calls from Big Brands but I turned them down all because they wanted me to work
full time and on-site and I couldn’t stay given that I was still a student

I got offers from brands like;

1.Amplify pay

1. Thank you card

2. MAXNG etc.

I also applied to the [Andela](https://medium.com/@Andela) fellowship, I almost
left school for the fellowship when I got into the Bootcamp but I was adviced by
friends to finish school first since I am almost done. I attended the boot camp
though but I didn’t even make it into the 2nd week because I couldn’t handle the
stress and I was quite unserious :) :) but I learnt so much within just a week.

In August 2018 I made this tweet

and guess what I got a whole lotta retweet and I had a few offers from several
companies outside Nigeria and finally, I accepted an offer as a Frontend
Engineer in an [AI startup](https://legalrobot.com/) in the US.

It actually changed my life and the way I think and Act, I had so much attention
on me and the responsibilities grew on me but it didn’t change my personality
though:) :)

There’s so much I’ve achieved in 2018 that I want to share but I really don’t
want to get y’all bored so I’ll just highlight few of them.

In 2017 I listed my plans for 2018, although I didn’t achieve all I was able to
achieve few

<span class="figcaption_hack">Some of my 2018 plans</span>

I was able to achieve 3,5,6,7,9,10. So I’m taking my unachieved 2018 plans into 2019.

### SPEAKING

I spoke at my first tech conference in 2018, it was at the largest React
Conference in Africa. It was a really big feat for me, Thank you [Innocent
Amadi](https://medium.com/@tru2cent) for giving me the opportunity.

I’d like to also thank [Brian Holt](https://medium.com/@btholt) for helping me
review my slides for the Conference, I appreciate Man.

I also was invited to be a Judge at [NaijaHacks](http://naijahacks.com/) Nigeria
official Hackathon alongside very important people in the tech ecosystem in
Nigeria and beyond it was a huge honour for me because I was the youngest judge
NaijaHacks ever had ( small boy, Big God :) :))

I spoke at smaller events and meetups too, I even was invited as a guest to a
WhatsApp group to talk about Securing a Remote Job.

<span class="figcaption_hack">i really enjoyed the discussion</span>

I was supposed to do a live coding session in December 2018 but I cancelled at
the last minute because I wasn’t prepared mentally and I apologize to the
organizers of TASUED Developers community

### WRITING

I didn’t write much in 2018, for reasons I don’t even know I’m guessing it was
procrastination, But I was able to write just one article on using
[GitLab](https://medium.com/@gitlab) and Javascript, Links below:

[https://codeburst.io/practical-introduction-to-javascript-debugger-7d6da51964f2](https://codeburst.io/practical-introduction-to-javascript-debugger-7d6da51964f2)

So in this year 2019, I plan to write 52 Articles. Yeah, you heard me 52
Articles and I’ll be dropping them every week in each month on my Blog…… [JS
SECRETS](https://sheddynathan.me/)

I didn’t want to share this but I got invited to the [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
technical writers’ program, Although I haven’t written an article yet I plan to
drop my first article in January or February, just wait on it.

### READING
